# Noto ( RoFriender )
RoFriender was originally intended to be a standalone app that users could download and install on their devices. However, after further consideration, it was decided that making RoFriender a chrome extension would be a more practical and convenient solution.

As a chrome extension, RoFriender can be easily installed and accessed from the user's browser without the need for any additional downloads. This makes it more accessible and user-friendly for a wider audience.

In addition to being more convenient for users, developing RoFriender as a chrome extension also allowed for faster development and easier maintenance. Overall, the decision to make RoFriender a chrome extension was based on the desire to create a more efficient and user-friendly tool for managing friends on Roblox.
